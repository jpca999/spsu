			<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Moving Help Services LLC</strong> is privately owned and is not affiliated with any state or federal government agency including the USPS ®. Government forms can be obtained for no charge from state and federal agencies.
<br><br>
<strong>Moving Help Services LLC</strong> is a third party business entity that facilitates the address change request process for its users and acts as an authorized agent for those wishing to submit an address change filing to the USPS ®.
<br><br>
By submitting your address change, you are authorizing this change of address service to act as agent for the purpose of changing the address listed on this order for the postal service at USPS ® (US Postal Service ®, United States Postal Service ®, USPS.com ™, Post Office ™, or www.USPS.com ™), plus other organizations you designate, including use of any provided information by customer, authorized digital signature on your behalf. Unlimited address changes are allowed, per person only, from first order until 90-days after first order date, and address change must be in the same person’s exact name as the first order.
<br><br>
You also acknowledge that this change of address service will attempt to notify all parties for address changes and other requests, and you further acknowledge that the request is not guaranteed due to factors outside of this service’s control. As such, you agree that while this site will attempt to make every reasonable effort to perform the change of address services put forth, it shall not be liable for such notifications to be performed whatsoever, by the organizations you have specified.
<br><br>
The person who prepares this form states that he or she is the person, executor, guardian, authorized officer, or agent of the person for whom mail would be forwarded by the postal service at USPS ® (US Postal Service ®, United States Postal Service ®, USPS.com ™, Post Office ™, or www.USPS.com ™) under this order. Anyone submitting false or inaccurate information on this form is subject to punishment by fine or imprisonment or both under Sections 2, 1001, 1702 and 1708 of Title 18, United States Code.
<br><br>
The preparer also hereby authorizes this change of address service to file postal service at USPS ® (US Postal Service ®, United States Postal Service ®, USPS.com ™, Post Office ™, or www.USPS.com ™) documents on my behalf as a TPD (Third Party Designee) and agree to all terms of service related to this postal service. You also agree to allow up to 10-14 days for the postal service at USPS ® (US Postal Service ®, United States Postal Service ®, USPS.com ™, Post Office ™, or www.USPS.com ™) to process your change of address.
<br><br>
<strong>Moving Help Services LLC</strong> charges a document preparation and processing fee of $49.95 to help cover the costs of using our online change of address service and to pay for our time to manually follow-up with the USPS ® on your behalf so you don’t have to do it yourself. Plus, included with our service, we will also help you with connecting your home utility services at your new address, help you research and find the best deals on home entertainment services available in your area, help you get cost-comparisons for home security alarm systems and video monitoring services, reduce the clutter of receiving unwanted junk mail at your new address, and even add you to the do-not-call list to help protect your privacy from receiving unwanted spam phone calls from telemarketers.
<br><br>
Your satisfaction is extremely important to us. That’s why we are so confident that you will be thrilled with our third party assistance service that we guarantee it. If you are not satisfied with our service, we offer a "no questions asked" refund within 60-days. Please call us at 1-844-300-5039 to request a full refund. (note: refunds can take up to 7-10 business days to be processed by the processor and bank)
